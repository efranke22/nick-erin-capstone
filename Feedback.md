**Brianna's Feedback**

An introduction the data context (who, what, where, why, when, how) and the data

- Good, clear

An introduction to your research question and why it is important

- Great background and intro

A discussion and justification of your models that explains WHY you made your choices

- Good justificaitons for lasso
- With Matern correlation, capitalize M in Matern. It is nu (smoothness parameter), not mu (usually refers to the mean). Say that you use nu = 0.5, which means  the Matern correlation is equivalent to spatial expoential decay. Rho is a measure of range of correlation (how far two points are correlated) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%A9rn_covariance_function


A presentation of the results of your models

- We typically don't interpret in terms of log odds; you could rearrange to discuss odds ratios
- Good discussion of why you might see the results you do in your model (visuals and model interpretations)
- when you say "mean estimated error", did you take the absolute error or square the errors first?
- 

A discussion of your conclusions based on the model and the limitations to the conclusions you can make.

- Great!
